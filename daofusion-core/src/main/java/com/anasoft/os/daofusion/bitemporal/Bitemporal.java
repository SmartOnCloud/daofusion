/**
 * A bitemporal object. A bitemporal object is essentially a value tracked in two time dimensions:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><i>Validity time</i> - indicates when the value was valid.
 * 	<li><i>Recording time</i> - indicates when the value was known.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Tracking information bitemporally allows you to aswer questions along the lines of
 * "On January 2, 1999, what did we think the valid value was for September 1, 1980?".
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * In most cases, application level should not directly implement this interface, but should
 * instead wrap existing value classes bitemporally using a {@link BitemporalWrapper}.
