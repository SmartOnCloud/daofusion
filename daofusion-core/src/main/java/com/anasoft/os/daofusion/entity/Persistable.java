/**
 * Generic persistent entity contract used
 * by the {@link PersistentEntityDao}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Implementations of this interface must follow some
 * general rules regarding JPA object-relational mapping
 * concepts:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Each persistent entity must specify database
 * 		identity field(s) which will be reflected as
 * 		primary key(s) within the underlying database
 * 		table. There are basically two ways to manage
 * 		the database identity:
 * 		<ul>
 * 			<li><em>simple</em> primary key approach -
 * 				use the {@link Id} annotation to mark
 * 				a single <tt>id</tt> field to be used
 * 				as the primary key. It is common to mark
 * 				the <tt>id</tt> field using the
 * 				{@link GeneratedValue} annotation as well
 * 				in case the identifier should be
 * 				automatically assigned upon persistent
 * 				entity creation.
 * 			<li><em>composite</em> primary key approach -
 * 				use the {@link Embeddable} annotation to
 * 				mark the primary key class and join it
 * 				with the persistent entity using {@link IdClass}
 * 				and {@link Id} annotations. In case of necessary
 * 				primary key field association overrides, it is
 * 				advised to use {@link Embeddable} and
 * 				{@link EmbeddedId} annotations instead.
 * 		</ul>
 * 	<li>Mutable persistent entities should use the
 * 		{@link Version} annotation to mark an optimistic
 * 		lock value (version) field. This way, the underlying
 * 		persistence provider is able to enforce optimistic
 * 		locking strategy on the persistent entity.
 * 	<li>Each persistent entity must provide a <b><u>reliable</u></b>
 * 		{@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)}
 * 		implementation which covers all possible entity states.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * There are basically two approaches to implementing
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)}
 * methods:
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><em>business key</em> approach - set of "semi"-unique
 * 		attributes that uniquely describe the persistent
 * 		entity as a whole (this attribute combination is
 * 		unique for each persistent entity instance). However,
 * 		this imposes certain limitations on attributes within
 * 		the set which could potentionally break the
 * 		{@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)}
 * 		method contract (for example, uniqueness might be
 * 		broken if any of the "semi"-unique attributes change,
 * 		persistent entity instance has to have all "semi"-unique
 * 		attributes set in advance for {@link Object#hashCode()} and
 * 		{@link Object#equals(Object)} to work properly, etc.).
 * 	<li><em>synthetic generated value</em> approach - generate
 * 		a globally-unique identifier value and assign it to
 * 		the <tt>oid</tt> field upon the persistent entity
 * 		instance creation. The <tt>oid</tt> field serves as
 * 		an object identity, allowing the entity to be contained
 * 		within collections and properly handled between multiple
 * 		persistence sessions. This approach essentially tries to
 * 		separate the object identity and object value concepts
 * 		from each other (unlike the <em>business key</em>
 * 		approach which combines them together).
 * </ul>
 * 
 * As for the <em>inheritance mapping strategy</em>, it is up
 * to the user to mark specific root nodes within the persistent
 * entity hierarchy via the {@link Inheritance} annotation
 * as appropriate. Keep in mind that the default JPA inheritance
 * strategy is set to {@link InheritanceType#SINGLE_TABLE} along
 * with its implications on the underlying database schema.
 * 
 * @param <ID> Java type of the primary key column.
