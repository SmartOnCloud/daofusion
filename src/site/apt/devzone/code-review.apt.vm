Code Review
  
  In addition to the {{{../issue-tracking.html} issue tracker}} for reporting and commenting on project issues, we encourage committers to use
  {{{http://codereview.appspot.com/} Rietveld}} code review application hosted on {{{http://code.google.com/appengine/} Google App Engine}}
  prior to committing their changes into the {{{../source-repository.html} source code repository}}.
  
  Code reviews enable project members to comment on patch sets (sets of diffs for a particular revision) made by committers, which improves
  the overall code quality along with some other positive side effects, such as:
  
  * project members are aware of impacts caused by the issue implementation, staying up to date with the current state of the project
  
  * code reviews promote a common "coding culture" (conventions, patterns and best practices applied to the source code) across the community
  
  []
  
Before you commit
  
  If you're a committer working on specific issue(s):
  
  * Do NOT commit your local changes or close any issues immediately.
  
  * Log in to {{{http://codereview.appspot.com/} Rietveld}} with your {{{https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount} Google Account}}.
  
  * Create a code review issue for any issue(s) you have implemented for the corresponding SVN base (maintenance branch or trunk).
  
  * Invite other project members (committers and contributors alike) for a code review by using <Publish + Mail Comments> feature
    as well as posting code review issue URL(s) for related issues within the {{{../issue-tracking.html} issue tracker}}.
  
  * See {{{http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/CodeReviewHelp} this guide}} for detailed information about the code review process.
